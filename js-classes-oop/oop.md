# JS classes and history Of classes
1. Yes, JavaScript has classes. Classes were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more convenient and clearer syntax to create objects and handle inheritance.

## Key Features of JavaScript Classes:

### Constructor: The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created with a class.
### Methods: Methods are functions defined inside a class. They are defined without the function keyword and are available on instances of the class.
### Inheritance: Classes can extend other classes using the extends keyword. This allows for creating a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a parent class.
